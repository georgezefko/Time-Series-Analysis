The notebooks below used for exploration. They might be a bit messy as they haven't cleaned properly
*EDA_SM* where the preliminary analysis takes places

*AnomalyExploration* Exploration analysis, labeling, feature engineering, training, oversampling (it might be a bit messy)

*AlarmsEDA* Alarms exploration
